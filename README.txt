Project description :
Our website is designed to allow members to select a flight and a seat on it. 
To become a member you must register on the website. 
Upon login, a session is created so that the member or admin can see their respective pages.
 The members' page allows for only the picking of a flight, members can also use a voucher code, what will do discount for them.
 The members have to select available flight and chose seats to buy tickets.
 Input validation is implemented to reduce the risk of members picking the same seat on a flight.
 Our system can be used in the airport as an internal program for ticket sealing or can be implemented as website based ticket sealing system.
 Navigation is easy because of limited functionalities of the webpage. users just have the home page and the page in which they can order tickets.
 Navigation interface is on top of the website and thanks to bootstrap it changing for mobile users.
 
 Sections we completed:
 we have fully functional admin system which registers new flights for users.
 However the website is just small software concentrated on specific tasks so, it depends on business needs of the company.
 In order to expend project its necessary to study business needs and integrate software into an active company.
 
 This website have just 2 admins, admins have a specific job to add flights or cancel them.
 On the other hand, users can be airport employees or online customers.
